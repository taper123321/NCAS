   overclock function", although depending on the model or settings it is also
   the downclocking function.

   The process of changing clock speeds is non-trivial, requires waiting for
   the DMA to finish its work and slightly affects running timers. You should
   avoid changing the clock speed constantly if not necessary. If this function
   detects that the desired clock speed is already in use, it returns without
   performing any change.

   Currently the clock speed is not reset during a world switch nor when
   leaving the add-in. */
